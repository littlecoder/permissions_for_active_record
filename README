PermissionsForActiveRecord
==========================

This plugin adds a simple permission system to specified ActiveRecords and a helper method to easily blend-in/blend-out certain parts of a view based upon view-permissions on single methods. It is based on technoweenie's restful-authentication and is inspired by hobo's permission system.

The method "current_user" generated be restful-authentication is passed to the ActiveRecord and can be used to determine if a ActiveRecord can be created, udpated, viewed or destroyed.


Setup
=====

You have to install restful-authentication first.
Add this line after the setup of restful-authentication:

before_filter :pass_current_user

This line will propagate the current_user as acting_user in all ActiveRecords, where the permission system is activated.


To use the permission system add the following line to an ActiveRecord:

add_permissions

Now you can implement the methods
creatable?, updateable?, viewable? and destroyable? in the ActiveRecord. If you return false the active_record cannot be created, updated, viewed or destroyed. Corresponding before_filters are called.


Example
=======

Let's say the ActiveRecord User is used for restful-authentication and stores all user data.
We want Posts only to be updated and destroyed by their owner and to be created only by a logged-in user.
We also want the internal_comment only be viewable by the author.

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

  belongs_to :owner, :class_name => 'User'

  has_permissions

  def creatable?
    acting_user != :false
  end

  def editable?
	acting_user != :false and acting_user.id == owner.id
  end

  def destroyable?
	acting_user != :false and acting_user.id == owner.id
  end

  def viewable? field
	field != :internal_comment or owner.id == acting_user.id
  end

end


To filter the field automatically in the view use the view_for helper:

<% view_for @post |o| -%>
  <h1><%= o.title %></h1>
  <p><%= o.text %></p>
  <% o.internal_comment do |a| -%>
    <h2>Your Internal Comment</h2>
    <p><%= a %></p>
  <% end %>
<% end -%>


Tests
=====

The SQLite3-Adapter is required for the tests.
